## Setup

## `.env` requirements (where applicable)

i.e.

- `PORT` - Port Number
- `MONGODB_URI` - URL to the running mongo instance/db

## How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)

clone the repo

`npm i`

create thing.txt file 

`node app.js thing.txt` to capitalize the contents of your text file! Neat! 

### Tests

Still need to figure out how to test convertToBuffer()

See app.test.js.
